The state upon starting the project is the "warm-up" mode. The lights are moving for player introductions and ball racks are at the top of the key for warm-ups. Press 'k' to switch to "game mode". Just like at the CU Event Center the court is bright and the light falls off quick into the bleachers making the court seem as if glowing. Most arenas are uniformly lit so this is a unique attribute of the CUEC. Another special feature of the CU event center is the ceiling-hung hoops. The only other power 5 conference basketball arena to have such hoops in the NCAA is Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke University; not bad company to be apart of. Such hoops are thanks to the age of the arena which leaves very little room on our baselines. I did my own take on the court details based on what textures I could find and make work. It was easiest to cleanly inegrate all of the details such as "COLORADO" word mark on the baselines, retro center logo and on-court mountains(using texture) using a white color scheme. Which maybe I think CU could consider if this project gets in front of the Athletic Directors eyes... maybe.

In either warm-up or game-mode the user can press '1' or '2' to shoot baskets at the away or home hoops. The score is tallied on the jumbotron in the middle (limit of 199 like retro arenas due to non-digital displays). As the ball passes through the net, the net moves backwards as a net in real life. Also last minute the swish sound effect was added in which is queued on the net moving. Additionally, I have simple "video board" functionality on the jumbotron that can be played by pressing or holding 'j'... also played on the laptops at the scorers table. The clip shown on hte project is KJ Simpson hitting a buzzer beater to beat the Florida Gators in the first round of the 2024 NCAA March Madness tournament.

AI was used to get the macro BEZIER to map the motion of ball in drawCompleteBasketballCourt() fcn, the motion of the net (-asin(a)) in the idle() and the function playSwish() to make the system call to play the swish sound effect.

I am most proud of my ability to capture all major unique details of the CU Event Center and piece them together to allow myself to not just draw "a scene" but an actual environmemt here on campus.
